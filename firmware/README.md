# Firmware

The `adafruit-testing` folder contains very crude code used for I2C communication with an [Adafruit BNO085 breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4754#technical-details). This code is **not** intended to be used for project with the breakout board, it was used to check the minimum number of pins needed to communicate with the BNO085.

The `bno085-firmware` submodule contains the production code for the sensor. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/tgodfrey0/bno085-i2c-firmware).
