# Firmware

The firmware is written in C for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

The `adafruit-testing` folder contains the code used for I2C communication with an [Adafruit BNO085 breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4754#technical-details).

All code can be compiled using CMake and a generator of your choice.
